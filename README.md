# RPiCAN

This project aims to establish CAN communication between a Raspberry Pi and an STM32 microcontroller, integrating sensor data monitoring and LED control within a home automation system using Domoticz.

## STM32 (Bluepill)

The project utilizes an STM32F103C8 ("Bluepill") microcontroller, connected via I2C to:
- **MCP9808** ‚Äì Temperature sensor
- **TSL2851** ‚Äì Luminosity sensor  
Additionally, an LED is connected to the STM32.  

Every 10 seconds, the STM32:
- Collects measurements from the sensors.
- Transmits these measurements via CAN frames over the CAN bus to the Raspberry Pi.
- Determines the LED state based on the detection of a specific CAN frame on the bus.

### CAN Frame Data Field Format
| Data Type   | DLC | Format                                    |
|-------------|-----|--------------------------------------------|
| Temperature | 3   | Byte1: `0x11`, Byte2-3: Temperature data  |
| Luminosity  | 3   | Byte1: `0x22`, Byte2-3: Luminosity data   |
| LED State   | 2   | Byte1: `0x33`, Byte2: LED State           |

The STM32 communicates over CAN using pins:
- A11: `CANRx`
- A12: `CANTx`  
These connect to a CAN transceiver providing differential CANH and CANL signals.

## Raspberry Pi with MCP2515

Since the Raspberry Pi lacks a native CAN interface, we use the **MCP2515** SPI-to-CAN controller. The **HW-184** module integrates an MCP2515 and a CAN transceiver, converting SPI frames to CAN differential signals and vice versa.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Voltage Adjustment:**  
The HW-184 module is powered at 5V, but the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs GPIO operates at 3.3V. Direct connection risks damaging the Pi. To resolve this:
- Disconnect the Vcc connection between MCP2515 and the transceiver.
- Power the MCP2515 with 3.3V and the transceiver with 5V.  
The transceiver interprets 3.3V logic levels from the MCP2515 as valid "high" signals.

## Software

- The provided Raspberry Pi code listens to incoming CAN frames and can transmit messages.
- Integration with **Domoticz** allows data visualization and LED control via a home automation interface.

## Domoticz Integration

[Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/) is a home automation platform that supports monitoring and control of various devices:
- Lights, switches, sensors (temperature, rain, wind, UV, electricity, gas, water, etc.)

In this project:
- Domoticz displays temperature and luminosity readings from the sensors.
- LED control is handled through specific CAN frames sent by Domoticz via MQTT to the Raspberry Pi.
